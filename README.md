# MARIE-SIM
A constantly WIP Simulator for the MARIE architecture

# What is MARIE?
MARIE, standing for Machine Architecture that is Really Intuitive and Easy, is an educational, theoretical machine architecture
created by Linda Null and Julia Lobur. 

# Why are you making this?
As of the initial commit in October of 2023, I'm in a Computer Systems and Architecture course at Northern Illinois University
that is taking a look at this architecture, and I'm working on this simulation for my own self-improvement to understand
the architecture more deeply and to work on my C++ skills. 

# Other Options
As of the initial posting, this software only supports hex machine code in a strict format, and a lack of bugs is far from guaranteed.
